This the Obsidian Vault documentation for this repository.

You can view these files however you like - markdown is quite friendly to its plaintext - but it's preferable to use [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

Some files you may not be able to read (e.g. [[Code Structure.canvas|Code Structure]]); they're meant to be viewed with obsidian.
